Hi This is Shubham Pachori, Graduate Student In University of Connecticut

This repository contains my machine learning codes, I have implemented following algorithms:
1) Linear regression with or without Regularization.

2) Logistic Regression with multi class classification as One vs All.

3) Understand the concept of Bias(under-fitting) nad Variance(Overfitting).

4) Non-linear SVM -support vector machine with Guassian kernel.

5) Neural network and designed a simple application of understanding hand-written digits with digit recognizer.


I am constantly learning and try to implement more sophisticted algorithms like natural language procession(NLP) 
and Deep learning in the near future.
